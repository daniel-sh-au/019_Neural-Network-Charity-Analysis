# Module 19: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary classifier that would be capable of predicting if applicants would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset contained 34,000 organizations that have recieved funding from Alphabet Soup. In this analysis, the data was preprocessed, compiled, trained, and evaluated using a neural network model. Finally, the model was optimized to achieve a predictive accuracy of 75%.
